A Dufs-based, lightweight cross-platform file distribution GUI optimized for **air-gapped LANs and restricted industrial environments**. Built on [dufs](https://github.com/sigoden/dufs). **Zero config, zero barrier** — share a folder or a single file from one device, and anyone with a browser can access and transfer it. The other side needs no app.

## ✨ Why FileInfra?

> **The other side doesn't need an app.** Install FileInfra on ONE device, start the server, and anyone with a browser can upload and download files.

| Feature | |
|:---|:---:|
| 📱 **One device is enough** | The rest use a browser |
| 📄 **Folder or single file** | Share a full directory or just one file |
| ⬆️⬇️ **Bidirectional** | Upload AND download, not just send |
| 🔗 **Just open a link** | QR code or URL — that's all the other side needs |
| 🔐 **Secure** | Optional password auth, CORS control |
| 🔀 **Fine-grained permissions** | Upload, delete, search, archive download — toggle each one |
| 🎨 **Customizable** | 6 color schemes + dark / light mode |
| 🌐 **Multilingual** | 简体中文 · 繁體中文 · English |
| 📦 **Zero setup** | Self-contained — no external dependencies |

---

## 💡 Use Cases

| Scenario | How |
|:---|:---:|
| 🏭 **Factory / industrial offline transfer** | One PC starts → operators scan → distribute firmware / logs / docs |
| 🏠 **Home file sharing** | Phone hotspot → browser access → transfer photos / docs |
| 💼 **Office quick transfer** | One PC starts → colleagues scan → share project files |
| 🎓 **Classroom distribution** | Teacher starts → students scan → download courseware |
| 🔧 **Device debugging** | Embedded device → phone hotspot → download logs |
| 📷 **Photo dump** | Camera/phone starts → PC bulk downloads |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download

| Platform | File | |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| 🪟 **Windows** | `fileinfra-*-windows-x64-setup.exe` (installer) or `.zip` (portable) | ✅ Tested |
| 🤖 **Android** | `fileinfra-*-android-universal.apk` (arm64-v8a · armeabi-v7a · x86_64) | ✅ Tested |
| 🐧 **Linux x64** | `.AppImage` (zero deps) or `.deb` | ✅ Tested |
| 🐧 **Linux ARM64** | `.AppImage` or `.deb` (Kylin/UOS compatible) | ✅ Tested |
| 🍎 **macOS** | `FileInfra-*-macos-arm64.zip` | ⚠️ Untested |

> 📥 [Download latest release](https://github.com/zocs/fileinfra/releases)
>
> 🤖 Also available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) (pending review)

### Steps

1. Pick a folder or a single file
2. Tap "Start Server"
3. Scan QR code or enter URL in browser (port required)
4. Share files — done!

> Recent builds also add a smoother start/stop transition state, so slower devices feel less abrupt when the embedded file server is starting or shutting down.

---

## 🌐 Network

> **Simplest setup:** All devices on the same WiFi or hotspot.

| Environment | |
|:---|:---:|
| 🏠 **Same WiFi** | Just connect and share |
| 📱 **Phone hotspot** | One device creates a hotspot, others join — no router needed |
| 🌍 **Remote access** | Works with ZeroTier, Tailscale, EasyTier, or any VPN |

> 🔒 **All transfers happen directly between your devices. No data passes through third-party servers.**

---

## 🔒 Security

> ⚠️ FileInfra binds to all network interfaces by default (`0.0.0.0`)

| Network | Recommendation |
|:---|:---:|
| Home WiFi | ✅ Safe — LAN only |
| Public WiFi | ⚠️ Enable password auth |
| Corporate network | ⚠️ Watch firewall policies |
| Public internet | ❌ Not recommended — use VPN instead |

**Best practices:**
1. Enable auth in public environments
2. Stop the server when done
3. Review access logs periodically

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Android — Storage Permission

**Symptom:** Can't list files, "Need all files access permission"

**Fix:** Settings → Apps → FileInfra → Permissions → Allow "All files access"

### Port in Use

**Symptom:** Start fails, "Port XXX already in use"

**Fix:** Change port (try 8080–9000 range) or kill the occupying process

### Linux — AppImage Won't Launch

**Symptom:** Double-click does nothing

**Fix:**
```bash
chmod +x fileinfra-*.AppImage
./fileinfra-*.AppImage
```

### macOS — Developer Verification Blocked

**Symptom:** "Can't verify developer" on open

**Fix:**
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine FileInfra.app
```

### Windows — Firewall Blocking

**Symptom:** Other devices can't connect

**Fix:** Allow FileInfra through Windows Firewall (you'll be prompted on first launch)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does the other side need FileInfra?**
A: No! Only one device runs FileInfra. Others just open a browser.

**Q: Can I share a single file instead of a whole folder?**
A: Yes. Choose a single file and FileInfra will expose just that file through the browser.

**Q: Can I access it remotely?**
A: LAN by default. For remote access, use ZeroTier / Tailscale / EasyTier.

**Q: Is HTTPS supported?**
A: Not yet. Planned for a future release.

**Q: Max file size?**
A: No hard limit. Tested with a single 70GB+ archive over gigabit LAN — sustained full bandwidth throughout. Large downloads may have a brief delay while loading file info, which is normal. Actual speed depends on filesystem, disk I/O, and Wi-Fi throughput.

**Q: How many devices can connect at once?**
A: No hard limit — depends on bandwidth and device performance.

**Q: Are files uploaded to the cloud?**
A: No! Everything stays local. Transfers are device-to-device.

## 🛠️ Development

### Requirements

- Flutter SDK 3.41+
- Windows: VS Build Tools 2022 (C++ workload)
- Android: Android SDK, NDK
- Linux: clang, lld, llvm, libgtk-3-dev
- macOS: Xcode

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zocs/fileinfra.git
cd fileinfra
flutter pub get

# Run (debug)
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d android

# Build
flutter build windows --release
flutter build apk --release
```

### Packaging Scripts

```bash
# Linux (x64 or ARM64)
bash scripts/build_linux.sh x86_64
bash scripts/build_linux.sh aarch64

# macOS (ARM64)
bash scripts/build_macos.sh aarch64
```

Output: AppImage, deb, rpm, tar.gz (Linux) and zip (macOS).

### Local Docker Builds

```bash
# Android release APK (optionally pass signing env vars)
bash scripts/docker_build_android.sh

# Linux x64 packages
bash scripts/docker_build_linux.sh x86_64
```

Notes:
- The Docker workflow currently supports Android and Linux x64 only.
- Windows Docker packaging can be explored later.
- macOS and iOS remain GitHub Actions-only because they require native Apple toolchains.
- The Android Docker image generates `android/local.properties` inside the container so host SDK paths are not required.
- Outputs land under `docker_build/`: `docker_build/android/outputs/apk/` (APKs) and `docker_build/linux/x86_64/outputs/packages/` (AppImage/deb/tar.gz).

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions builds all platforms on tag push (`v*`) and creates a release automatically.

```

Desktop builds embed `dufs` through Rust FFI; Android uses a foreground native service to survive Activity recreation on lower-memory devices.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

FileInfra is built on top of [dufs](https://github.com/sigoden/dufs) — a brilliant utility file server by [sigoden](https://github.com/sigoden). Without dufs, FileInfra wouldn't exist. Thanks for making file sharing so simple.
